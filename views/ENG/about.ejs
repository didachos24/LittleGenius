            <p>Our program is licensed by Chicago City and the Illinois Department of Children and Familiy Services (DCFS). 
                The program philosophy of child care in The Little Genius is to promote the growth of our children social, cognitive,
                emotionally and physically with a variety of activities leading by teachers, and others leading by childrens themselves. 
                The activities are designed to develop creativity, communication and self esteem. Individual and cultural diversity is 
                respected and promoted, each child is treated as an individual with different needs, culture and special cares. Serving 
                a diverse community gives us the opportunity to explore each child's heritage and traditions to enrich the learning of every
                community actor.
            </p> 

            <p>
                We truly believe that with a healthy environment  in home, schools and communities, the children will have the opportunity to 
                grow and be successful. This is possible with cooperation between teachers and parents, with parents as first children's educator.
